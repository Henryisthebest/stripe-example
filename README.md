### Quick-and-Easy Third Party Integration With Stripe

This is an example app demonstrating how to integrate Stripe with a Backand application. Stripe is a popular third-party API offering payment-related functionality, allowing you to accept payments for yourself as well as your customers. Whether youâ€™re building a marketplace, mobile app, online storefront, or subscription service, [Stripe](https://stripe.com) has the features you need.

Payment systems should always be built with a solid back-end, in order to protect the security of your users and customers. With Backand's server-side actions, we'll be able to provide the piece of mind that comes with a custom-built server back end, but without the expense and effort.

In this example we will use **angular-stripe** to wrap Stripe's stripe.js file. You can either use this in your own applications, or make use of any other solution you choose.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have **node.js** set up on your machine before beginning. Once you've set up Node, you'll also need to install **gulp** and **bower**. Luckily, Node Package Manager (NPM) makes this simple:

```bash
  $ npm -g install gulp bower
```
    
## Getting started

First, we need to create an account with Backand and create the base app:

* Navigate to [backand.com](https://www.backand.com/) and click `Sign Up`
* Create an app. You can name the app whatever you like, but make sure to make note of the title you select.
* Click on your new app's URL. Don't navigate away from the next page.

Once an account and app have been created, we're ready to start building out the back end. In the "New Hosted Database" section of the current page, keep the default JSON and just click 'Next'.

Next, clone the application's source code onto your local machine: 

```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/backand/stripe-example.git
  $ cd stripe-example
```
    
Before we can run the app, we need to use npm and bower to install the associated dependencies for the stripe example project:

```bash
  $ npm install
  $ bower install
```

Once the dependencies have been installed, we need to update the app's code to point at your new Backand application. Open the file **client/src/app/app.js** in a text editor, and make the following changes:

  * Replace **'Your-App-Name'** with the app name you selected when creating your Backand account
  * Replace **'Your-Anonymous-Token'** with your application's Anonymous token, obtained as follows:
    1. In Backand dashboard, under "Security & auth --> Configuration," enable Anonymous Access by clicking on the toggle on the right side of the page.
    2. Set the Anonymous users assigned role to 'User' in the provided drop down box.
    3. Copy the Anonymous Token from the text box in the Anonymous Access section.
    4. Replace **Your-Anonymous-Token** in your local copy of app.js with the value copied from the Backand dashboard.
  

## Configuring the App

Below we'll configure your Backand application. To get started:

1. Log in to [Backand](https://www.backand.com) using your admin login information
2. Open the application that you created in the previous section.

### Backand Action

Use the following steps to add an on-demand action that registers a payment with Stripe:

1. Open the Action tab for the `items` object (which can be found under the "Objects" menu in the Backand dashboard)
2. Click "+New Action" and enter the following details in the fields provided. Note that some fields for a step won't be available until the prior step has been completed:
  1. **Name:** makePayment
  2. **Event Trigger:** 'On Demand - Execute via REST API'
  3. **Type:** Server Side JavaScript Code
  4. **Input Parameters:** amount, token
  5. **JavaScript Code:** Past this code under the `// write your code here` comment, and before the `return {}` command

    ```javascript
      //Secret key - copy from your Stripe account https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys
      //or use Backand's test account
      var user = btoa("sk_test_hx4i19p4CJVwJzdf7AajsbBr:");
              
      response = $http({
        method: "POST",
        url: "https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges",
        params: {
            "amount":parameters.amount,
            "currency":"usd",
            "source": parameters.token
        },
        headers: {
            "Authorization": "Basic " + user,
            "Accept" : "application/json",
            "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
        }
      });
      
    return {"data":response};
    ```

  5. Press "Save"
  
## Run the app
  
Now we're ready to run the app! In your terminal window, simply type:

```bash    
  $ gulp serve
```

At this point, your application is running! You can access it at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**.

  
## Code Review

From this point, we only have a few steps left before we can complete our Stripe integration. Review the following code and copy it into your app in order to get your Backand app talking to Stripe.

#### Update publish key

In the file **client/src/app/app.js**, update your publishable Stripe key. You can copy it from your Stripe dashboard at https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys, or you can use Backand's test account in the code below. The resulting code will look like the following:

```javascript
  .config(function (stripeProvider) {
    //Enter your Stripe publish key or use Backand test account
    stripeProvider.setPublishableKey('pk_test_pRcGwomWSz2kP8GI0SxLH6ay');
  }) 
```

#### Calling Stripe.js to Submit a Payment

The method **self.charge** in file **/client/src/app/home/home.js** gets the form's data and makes a call to Stripe, getting the payment token and calling the makePayment function, which is a wrapper for the Backand Action we created earlier (more on this in a moment).

```javascript
  self.charge = function(){

    self.error = "";
    self.success = "";

    //get the form's data
    var form = angular.element(document.querySelector('#payment-form'))[0];

    //Use angular-stripe service to get the token
    return stripe.card.createToken(form)
      .then(function (token) {
        console.log('token created for card ending in ', token.card.last4);

        //Call Backand action to make the payment
        return BackandService.makePayment(form.amount.value, token.id )
      })
      .then(function (payment) {
        self.success = 'successfully submitted payment for $' + payment.data.data.amount/100;
      })
      .catch(function (err) {
        if (err.type && /^Stripe/.test(err.type)) {
          self.error = 'Stripe error: ' +  err.message;
        }
        else {
          self.error = 'Other error occurred, possibly with your API' + err.message;
        }
      });
  }
```

#### Backand Service to Call an On-Demand Action

The method **factory.makePayment** in the file **/client/src/common/services/backandService.js** calls the on-demand action we declared earlier in the dashboard. You must send the parameters **token** and **amount**, though you can send additional parameters as needed.

```javascript
  factory.makePayment = function(amount, token){
    return $http({
      method: 'GET',
      url: Backand.getApiUrl() + '/1/objects/action/items?name=makePayment',
      params:{
        parameters:{
          token: token,
          amount: amount
        }
      }
    });
  }
```
